# CRUD-Application

I recently created a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in my internship at AppSquadz using the powerful combination of React JS for the frontend, Node JS for the backend, and MongoDB for connecting the database to the server. 
This stack allowed me to build a fast, responsive, and user-friendly application that can handle data management with ease.
